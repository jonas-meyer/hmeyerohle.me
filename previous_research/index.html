intensifying competition constantly testing the frontiers in terms of locations, size, or tenant mix. The development of
shopping centers is taking place in a climate of an aging and shrinking population, economic uncertainties and
increasing differentiation within Japanese society and between metropolitan centers and the rest of Japan. Thus with
this project I not only want to look at the managerial techniques of shopping center development in Japan but also want
to look at shopping centers as places that mirror and to a certain degree also drive the above developments. A
sabbatical in Japan provided me with the opportunity to visit a large number of shopping centers and inner city shopping
districts.</p><p><strong>Japanese Workplaces in Transition</strong></p><p>In this project, I looked at changes in Japanese workplaces from the 1990s onwards. Here I employed an innovative
research approach by combining traditional research sources with accounts of restructuring as found in online diaries (
blogs). In their online diaries employees provide vivid accounts of experience at their work places and talk about their
concerns and motivations in an employment system that is showing signs of grave changes. In this project I looked at
employee perspectives on three areas, the downsizing of corporations, changes in employment conditions for regular
employees and the increasing number of non-regularly employed people and substantiated the findings from blog accounts
through survey results from Japanese government agencies and think tanks. (Book details below)</p><p><strong>Consumer Goods Distribution: especially Retailing</strong></p><p>In the study of the Japanese distribution system I am looking at several areas: The first area is the development of
Japanese retail formats. In my book &ldquo;Dynamics and Innovation in Japanese Retailing (details see below) I trace the
development of retail formats in Japan from the 1950s, beginning with the introduction of techniques such as
self-service and chain management and leading to the conceptualization of food supermarkets, general merchandising
stores, drug stores, home centers, and convenience stores. In looking at these developments I find it of special
importance to look at changes in the environment. For Japan emphasis has to be given to governmental distribution policy
and I have especially looked at the political economy of the retail sector. Another major factor are
manufacturer-retailer relationships. Japanese manufacturers have long strived for a dominance of their distribution
channels and were slow in accepting mass-merchandisers as legitimate sales channels for their products. Since the 1990s
various changes have occurred in the relationship between retailers and manufacturers and I have tried to analyze these
changes at an early stage. However, developments in retailing cannot be explained without looking at entrepreneurial
initiative and as in other countries Japan&rsquo;s retail sector has produced its fare share of entrepreneurs. I have looked
at entrepreneurship in Japanese retailing in the past and today and have found it to be a fascinating area of research
with entrepreneurs in this sector being strong and colorful personalities forcefully pursuing not only the growth of
their companies but also the diffusion of their retail concepts and philosophies. I have also looked at the activities
of foreign companies in Japan and here especially at how they are trying to drive change in the Japanese distribution
system (a short outline is here).</p><p><strong>International Marketing of Japanese Companies in Southeast Asia</strong></p><p>Within this research I focused on the marketing strategies of Japanese companies for the emerging markets of Southeast
Asia. Together with a colleague (Jochen Legewie) I have led a project that looked at strategies of Japanese and European
companies in Southeast Asia and have edited the book Corporate Strategies for Southeast Asia after the Crisis, myself
focusing especially on issues of marketing. I have also done additional work on Japanese retailers in Southeast Asia.</p></div></div></div><footer class="text-center pb-1"><small class=text-muted>&copy; 2024, Hendrik Meyer-Ohle<br></small></footer></body></html>
