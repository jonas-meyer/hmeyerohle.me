What role does
the human resources management department play in Japanese companies and is this role changing? What are the
expectations towards people working in human resources management and is professionalization advancing? This project is
being conducted in collaboration with Harald Conrad from Dusseldorf University.</p><p><strong>Current Issues in Japanese Retailing</strong></p><p>I continue my longstanding interest in retailing in Japan and the role of retailing in Japanese society. I have recently
looked at how convenience stores are to play an increasing role in catering for an aging and shrinking population. I
have also looked at employees in retailing, especially how companies have been dealing with increasing labour shortages.
Currently, I am looking at employment in the fashion industry as well as the consequences of a now long period of
shopping mall development on the outlook of Japanese cities.</p><p><strong>Internationalization of Human Resources and Diversity in Japanese Companies</strong></p><p>Japanese companies have begun to systematically recruit foreign employees into their operations in Japan. I am
investigating this new trend under the issues of international human resources management, workplace diversity,
migration brokerage and international talent mobility. This project is being conducted in collaboration with Harald
Conrad from Dusseldorf University.</p></div></div></div><footer class="text-center pb-1"><small class=text-muted>&copy; 2024, Hendrik Meyer-Ohle<br></small></footer></body></html>
